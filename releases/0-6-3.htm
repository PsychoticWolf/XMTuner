		<h2>Release 0.6</h2>
		<h3>June 13, 2010</h3>
		<p>XMTuner 0.6 is a new major release. Focus on this release has been improving and simplifying features, primarily in the main UI, as well as lots of bugfixing. New to this release is the "XM Service Control"
		utility. This little application is the new home for the "Service" tab for users of the XMTuner service, letting you manage and configure the service as well as see its log file, without having to run the 
		main XMTuner program. Other new features include support for favorite channels, an improved history tab that better matches the rest of the application; Addition of views (such as by category) for the channels
		tab; The URL builder panel, which takes the UI for generating links to playlists, feeds, channels, etc, for configuring your devices and places it in a single location, which can be hidden away when you're done
		with it; XMTuner is now resizable, no more being stuck only seeing a few channels; On Windows 7 and Vista, Aero glass is now featured in the UI, so it better fits in with the rest of your desktop.</p>
		<p>Behind the scenes, the server now supports channel playlists for better compatibility with some devices and media servers, the transcoder (if enabled) can now provide wav streams as well as mp3. XMTuner now 
		supports windows power management, and will shut down its server when your computer sleeps, and upon wake-up restart back to its previous state. Lots of crashes and exceptions have been fixed, too many to list
		here. XMTuner 0.6 also now supports auto-retrying your stream when there's a built-in player error, as part of a drive to improve the application's performance both in responsiveness and long-term usage. XMTuner
		starts up faster, is easier to use, and plays longer than before.</p>
