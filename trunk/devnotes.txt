FIX!

Crash when loading feed (null bitrate)
Broken default mms:// on whatson (and feed?!?)
Missing bitrate in generated URLs on whatsOn


====


Things from uXM:
* (WONTFIX) ASX - fetch URL and return the file w/ type
	--> Probably safe to exclude this given XMTuner's support for http urls. uXM only did mms
* XBMC Support - 
   Write files for each channel to user provided path
   XM <num> - <channel name (cleaned up for use in filename, strip all non-alphanumeric chars)>.strm 
      Contents, one line, plaintext, pointing to the http:// URL of the stream.
  (Not sure if this is worthwhile, seems there's a script for that platform http://www.leknifragonline.net/RunXM/)
* Need Panel for Displaying Channel URLs and Feed Path
--> Largely done, need to add feed link still
* Lineup Caching


* Finish hostname support
* Installer tweaks

TODO:
* Cleanup.. Relogin support should do more work
     Probably need to purge cookies and such as well.
* Recently Played Songs list
     
* Seperate server startup/shutdown from login.

* Player mode
* Service mode
